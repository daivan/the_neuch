# The Neuch
*It's all in the frame data.*

Two avatars fight on a stage divided into **5 horizontal slices**. You move between slices and attack. Same slice = full damage; distance reduces hit strength.

## How to play

- **Turn-based**: P1 acts, then P2, and so on.
- **Move**: Use the d-pad (or arrow keys) to move your avatar to an adjacent slice (left/right or up/down).
- **Attack**: Light / Medium / Heavy. Damage is full when you’re in the **same slice** as the opponent, reduced when at distance.

## Run locally

## Controls

- **Attacks**: Light / Medium / Heavy buttons or **Q / W / E**
